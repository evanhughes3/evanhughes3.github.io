        <h3>Positive Affirmation, and the Values Close to Me</h3>
        <br>

          <h4>1/18/15</h4>
        <br>
          <p>Upon examaning all the values important to me, I found it hard to focus on only a couple of them, because they are all related in some way.  They represent important human qualities, and they represent how we treat ourselves, each other, and the world around us.  But the value I chose to reflect upon is enthusiasm.</p>

          <p>The values I decided to inspect closer were: Ambition, Community, Competence, Creativity, Enthusiam, Growth, Hospitality, Innspiration, Integrity, Music, Nature, Quality, Romance.  What I found really interesting about this list was that it's almost split down the middle of qualities that are directly related to me, and qualities that are directed towards other people around me.  But I'm going to focus in on one in particular, enthusiasm.</p>

          <p>Enthusiasm sounds like a silly one perhaps.  Next to ambition and integrity, it doesn's sound as "deep," but it is a quality that I have always strived to have.  Have you ever met somebody who is so "into" what they do, that they convince you that it's the greatest thing ever?  It's an incredibly captivating feeling.  Being around a positive and enthusiastic person inspires a lot of joy, and it can make even the toughest tasks enjoyable.</p>

          <p>In my years playing a wide variety of gigs as a musician, enthusiasm is always something I look for in bandmates.  Not all gigs are great.  In fact most of them are not great.  But the people I like to surround myself with are the people who make the best out of bad situations.  They're the type of people who bring other's up with them, even if there is no reason to be high spirited.  This is the type of person I have always strived to be.</p>

          <p>As I touched on last week in light of "stereotype threat," positive affirmation is best cure.  I sometimes think to myself whether truly enthusiastic people are acutally that "into" what they're doing, or whether they understand themselves enough to know that they can "pump themselves up" by using enthusiasm as a positive affirmation.  It's not a bad idea.</p>

          <p>Next time hour 3 goes by on the same challenge, and your ready to throw your computer and give up, think to yourself "How cool is this! I'm creating something with my brain, and even though it's not working, look how close I am to getting it!  I definitely wouldn't have been able to get this far 9 weeks ago!"  Exclamation mark's aside, you get the point.</p>

          <p>Enthusiasm is infectious.  It inspires others to grow, be ambitious, be creative, have integrity, and so many of the other important values in life.</p>
