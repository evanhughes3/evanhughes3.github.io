        <h3>My Reflection of the First 3 weeks of DBC </h3>

          <h4>12/5/14</h4>
        <br>
          <p>  As we prepared to enter Phase-0 of Dev Bootcamp, we we're asked to complete a variety of surveys to examine our learning style, and thinking style.  I remember at the time thinking this was very unique.  Never had a class told me to examine these traits about myself before we started.  The test revealed that my thinking style is:</p>

          <p> <strong>Concrete Sequential </strong>Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.<p>

          <p><strong>Abstract Random </strong>Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.

          <p>As I look back at this, a couple things come to mind.  I have been very impressed by Dev Bootcamps structure of these first couple of weeks.  It seems as though each assignment is build upon the one previous, and I have really enjoyed that.  Now I see that my "concrete sequential" style of thinking really enjoys the linear structure of our challenges.</p>

          <p>My learning style was <strong>Aural</strong>.  This makes even more sense now.  There have been many challenges where after reading the given articles or chapters, I do not understand it.  So I search a question in google, then eventually land on youtube, and listen to someone teach it.</p>

          <p>I really enjoyed reading the articles Carol Dweck on Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset (I even bought the book! ...but haven't read it yet).  When learning about how the  “Growth intelligence mindset” means failure is launching board for new opportunity for growth and development, I thought to myself "I want that to be me!"  Well, it's a lot harder in reality.</p>

          <p>I think that the very nature of computer programming is figuring out a series of little puzzles.  So far git, html, css, and now ruby have all proven to have their own set of little puzzles that I wrestle with, and become incredible frustrated by.  I often times have to stop myself, step away from the computer, and try to come back to it fresh.  It will be important for me to keep the "growth intelligence mindset" in the weeks to come.  I need to reassure myself that learning this information is hard, and that getting stuck or failing is really just another way of learning new information.</p>

          <p>Bye for now.  I'm seeing Stevie Wonder tonight!</p>
