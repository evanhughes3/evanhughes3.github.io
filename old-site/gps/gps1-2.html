            <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pair programming is a practice where two people work together to share ideas to complete
                    a task or code a program.  It is becoming common in the field of technology because it
                    allows for easy collaboration during the process of coding.  It can help to reduce errors, and share or transfer knowledge.

            <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pair programming is important at DBC for many reason.  First, it brings people in to the community that they are a part of.  It's easy to feel isolated while learning this information from home, so pairing makes it seem a little more like a class.  Also, it allows people to share information with each other; what they have been strugling with, tricks they have picked up, etc.
                </p>
            <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
                <p>
                  Driving and navigating is the process in pair programming, where one person is the one doing the actual typing, and the other person is navigating them, or directing them on what to do.  The driver can communicate during this time, but his/her primary focus is getting the code down.  Often times pairs switch in between these two roles.
