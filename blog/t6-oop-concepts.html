        <br>
          <p>This week we dove deeper in classes in Ruby.  Classes provide great organizational structure to your code, because they allow you to group your code, and be able to call certain methods from a class only if they correspond to that class.  If we think about Ruby's inheritance structure, Modules are the parents to classes.  Where as a class and all of it's attributes and methods apply to each instance of a class, a Module can be applied to a class if it is included in that class.  We'll dive into that now, using the example of my cute, cuddly, and sometimes evil cat Scarlett.
          </p>

          <p>Scarlett was a rescue, and as is the case with a lot of rescues, whatever happened to them in those first weeks/months on the street, is sort of with them forever.  Scarlett is a great cat, but she has somewhat of a eating problem.  She loves chewing on fingers, eletrical cords, plastic, bugs, etc...  Let me respesent this with some code.</p>
          <pre>
class Kitty

  def initialize
    puts "What a cute kitten!"
  end

  def play
    puts "Oh look she's playing with her toy!"
  end

end

-------
scarlett = Kitty.new
scarlett.play

=> What a cute kitten!
=> Oh look she's playing with her toy!
</pre>
      <p>Pretty standard right?  I created an instance <code>scarlett</code>, of the class <code>Kitty</code>.  It is initialized with a statement, and has a method <code>play</code>, that says how cute she is when she plays with her toy.  But it's time to introduce you to <code>EvilCat</code>.</p>
        <pre>
module EvilCat

  def belly_rub
    puts "You want a belly rub? Oka......OUCH! YOU BIT MY FINGER!"
  end

end

class Kitty
  include EvilCat

  def initialize
    puts "What a cute kitten!"
  end

  def play
    puts "Oh look she's playing with her toy!"
  end

end

-------
scarlett = Kitty.new
scarlett.play
scarlett.belly_rub

=> What a cute kitten!
=> Oh look she's playing with her toy!
=> You want a belly rub? Oka......OUCH! YOU BIT MY FINGER!
</pre>
      <p>Let's break down what I just did.  I created a module, <code>EvilCat</code> which has a method that describes what happens every time you try to rub my cat's belly.  I then told the class <code>Kitty</code> to <code>include</code> this module.  What this means, is that all the methods in Module, are now available to my <code>Kitty</code> class.  If I had another class called, <code>Tiger</code> and I wanted it to include the <code>EvilCat</code> module, that is totally fine (they're both cats right??).  You can think of the "in" - "in-clude" give us an "in-stance" method.  ONE HUGE DIFFERENCE between a class and module though, is that you cannot create an instance of a module, or they cannot be "instantiated" like you can a class.  <code>EvilCat.new</code> does not make any sense to Ruby.</p>

      <p>This is sort of a silly example, but maybe to your suprise you have been using Modules all this time.  ENUMERABLE is a module, that is "included" in Arrays and Hashes.  Don't beleive me?  Go to that ever familiar <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">RubyDoc page for Arrays, http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html</a>, and scroll down until you see on the left, under the methods, you see "Included Modules: Enumerable."  Woah!  So what that means, is that there is an already existing module that contains all of the Enumberable methods, which we can use with arrays and hashes because they're already included.</p>

      <p>Pretty cool stuff.  Modules are great for "mixing-in methods."  Classes don't have to inherit from Modules, but we can mix those methods in if we choose.</p>
