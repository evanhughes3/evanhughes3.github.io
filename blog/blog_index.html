                This is a big one for me, and one that keeps coming up as I grow older.  Ulitmately the conflict is, do you disappoint a friend and not include them if the work is better without them.  It's a really, really, tough question, and one I don't have an answer for, but in this post I'm going to analyze it, and talk about the times it has happened in my life...</h3>

                One topic I have coninued to come across during phase 0 was "regex's" or Regular Expressions.  In some early challenges at DBC, they would have warning statements like "don't use Regular Expressions to solve this problem."  This got me thinking...so, regular expressions make solving this problem easy huh?  It's also hard to scan the pages of stackoverflow and not see regex's everywhere.  So, now that I'm a little more seasoned with all this stuff, I figure it's time to see what all the fuss is about...</h3>

                 <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                A fascinating new field in social psychology is the "Stereotype Threat."  Pioneered by Claude Steele, stereotype threat refers to the phenomenon of stereotyped individuals actually conforming to the stereotype they belong to.  The data is scary, because stereotype threats exist everywhere, and we are all constantly battling around them.  It shows us just how influenced we are by experiences around us, and how much our own psychology depends on our perception of ourselves. It reminds us how important positive re-enforcement is, and how detrimental negativity can be....</h3>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                This week we dove deeper in classes in Ruby.  Classes provide great organizational structure to your code, because they allow you to group your code, and be able to call certain methods from a class only if they correspond to that class.  If we think about Ruby's inheritance structure, Modules are the parents to classes.  Where as a class and all of it's attributes and methods apply to each instance of a class, a Module can be applied to a class if it is included in that class.  We'll dive into that now, using the example of my cute, cuddly, and sometimes evil cat Scarlett....</h3>

                When starting out at Dev Bootcamp, and reading about pair-programming, I thought only one thing; that this must be their way of forcing us to interact with our classmates.  One of the major problems with online education, though still in it's infancy, is there is no interaction between students.  So, it made sense to me why they would require this.  What I didn't really see coming was how beneficial pairing is to both learning and teaching the information...</h3>

You have a room full of new kids, many of whom you have never seen before, and your job is to start connecting and instructing them right away.  I thought it would make sense to make a nice little ruby program to help me remember the students in my class...</h3>
