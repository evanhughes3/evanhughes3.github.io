          <p>First of all, hello everyone, and welcome to my first blog post for Dev Bootcamp Phase 0!  It's been a really interesting week diving into this new material, and I'm excited to showcase some of the things I'm learning on this blog.</p>
          <br>
          I think that Dev Bootcamp has set us up really well in this first week.  Instead of starting right into the code, we learned about using the command line, version control software, git, GitHub, Twitter, and other industry standard stuff.  In seeing how often I have used git and GitHub just in this first week, I can tell we're going to be using them A LOT, so a good understanding of how they work and why we use them is important.</p>
