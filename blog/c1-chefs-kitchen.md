My Thoughts on the culture at DBC

11/20/14

After watching Shareef's Fireside Chat, I feel confident in the structure and philosophy they have established here at Dev Bootcamp.  I thought his point about us living our lives as consumers was very accurate.  We so often look at the outcome of an action before it has even started, completely missing the fact that the process is more important than the outcome.

In many ways it only reaffirms what I was drawn to in Dev Bootcamp, as I was surveying all the other programs out there.  Culture and community here are important.  Or me let say (because every school will say that), the culture and community are ESSENTIAL in learning this stuff in a matter of weeks.  They have made it very clear that our cohert is in this together, and it's up to us to make it great.

I have felt in many ways through my learning experiences in high school and college that the structure in place is flawed.  It doesn't promote inspired learning.  It goes like this:

1.  Study what's on the test
2.  Get a good grade
3.  Move on to the next subject
4.  Forget everything you learned, because you only took this class because your friend told you colleges/ grad schools want to see you completed it.

It doesn't force you to take learning into your own hands.  DBC believes that you have to want to learn something in order to learn it, and you have to have a voracious and passionate attitude about it.  It's the reason they have accepted us into this program, which most people would find crazy.

I'm very excited to meet all of you in person, outside of the cyber world.  I know were going to learn alot, and I'm excited for what's in store!
