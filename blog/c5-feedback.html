          <p>When starting out at Dev Bootcamp, and reading about pair-programming, I thought only one thing; that this must be their way of forcing us to interact with our classmates.  One of the major problems with online education, though still in it's infancy, is there is no interaction between students.  So, it made sense to me why they would require this.  What I didn't really see coming was how beneficial pairing is to both learning and teaching the information.</p>

          <p>I can truthfully say that I have learned something new each pairing session I've been in.  I am finding that everybody has their favorite methods, their little sublime tricks, their way of breaking down a problem, and all of them are different than mine.  Over time these have become incredible helpful.  There are so many ways to solve each of the challenges, and I find it really interesting how differently people approach a similar problem.</p>

          <p>Another part that I have found challenging, but extremeley benificial is talking out loud through my code.  Making sure I can explain every line of code.  This can be really tricky, especially when dealing with iteration with blocks of code inside.  But once you can follow the progression of an item through your code, you have a much better understanding of what it is your actually doing.  Understanding the vocabulary of these languages is just as important as being able to solve the challenge.</p>

          <p>Another important aspect of Dev Bootcamp's pairing is to provide feedback to your pair, so help them be aware of how they are working with others.  This definitely impressed me, because it created an environment that was open and honest, but also forces you to be accountable.</p>

          <p>Going back to look at the feedback written about me was really interesting.  Though no one's name is attatched, it feels as though everything about me is out in the open.  It's scary, but liberating.  One aspect that I continously saw that I remained enthusiatic even in the frustrating parts.  This made me feel good, because when working by myself and getting stuck, I lose a lot of my enthusiasm.  It shows how when pairing, I am accountable for my work with another person, so I have to remain calm for productive purposes and stay focused on getting the challenge done.</p>

          <p>Overall pairing has been really beneficial, and I look forward to doing it in class with my classmates sitting next to me.  I'm sure they will have a lot more to teach me. </p>
