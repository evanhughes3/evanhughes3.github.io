        <h3>How Screens Can Hurt Your Eyes</h3>

          <h4>12/13/14</h4>
        <br>
          <p>In the digital era that we live in, our lives our filled with...screens.  We're watching TV, while responding the emails on our computer, while watching the twitter feed on our phones.  Some might say we're addicted to our devices.  After a long day of staring at a computer at work, we come home and relax by staring at a different computer at home. One of the outcomes? Computer Vision Syndrom (CVS - I know, bad name right?).</p>

          <center><img src="../imgs/cvs-chart.jpg"></center>

          <p>Recent studies have shown that nearly 70 percent of American adults experience some form of digital eye strain due to prolonged use of electronic devices.  Another alarming study showed that  nearsightedness among Americans has increased from 25% to 41.6% percent over the past 30 years. </p>

          <p>You might be saying, "modern computer screens are a lot safer and less harmful to your eyes that old tube moniters."  Yes, to some extent.  But working on a computer is more challenging to your eyes than reading a book or piece of paper, because a computer screen also adds the elements of screen contrast, flicker, glare, as well as a usual bombardment of ad's jumping at your from the side of your screen.</p>

          <p>In my first couple of weeks of Dev Bootcamp, I have noticed the effect.  My eyes have felt more tired than usual.  So I decided to research this topic and provide some tips on how to keep your eyes relaxed, while working through an intensive computer program.</p>

          <h4>20-20-20</h4>

          <p>Every 20 minutes, spend 20 seconds looking at something 20 feet away.  20-20-20.  Find something as blank as possible; a wall with nothing on it, the hills in the distance, the sky if it's relatively clear (but not too close to the sun!).  These may be some of the only chances during the day your eyes get to actually taking a break.</p>

          <h4>Move the moniter back</h4>

          <p>When I'm deep into my coding, I'll sometimes find myself 6 inches from the computer screen.  When you realize that, <em>mooooooove</em> it back.  Think to the rule above, push the computer moniter 20 inches away from your eyes </p>

          <h4>Cut the glare</h4>

          <p>Glare may be the biggest cause of strain on your eyes.  If your overhead light is too bright, use a desk lap, and focus the desk lamp on the <em>desk</em> not on you.  You can also but <u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=glare%20filters">glare filter's </a></u>for all size screens.</p>

          <p>Follow some of these guidelines to keep your eyes fresh, and save yourself from the headaches of CVS.</p>
