          <p>A fascinating new field in social psychology is the "Stereotype Threat."  Pioneered by Claude Steele, stereotype threat refers to the phenomenon of stereotyped individuals actually conforming to the stereotype they belong to.  The data is scary, because stereotype threats exist everywhere, and we are all constantly battling around them.  It shows us just how influenced we are by experiences around us, and how much our own psychology depends on our perception of ourselves. It reminds us how important positive re-enforcement is, and how detrimental negativity can be.</p>

        <p>This field is really interesting to me on many levels.  I feel as though there are constantly new studies coming out about all the negative affects of bad social behavior.  Bullying, racism, and stereotyping have a much more profound effect on our lives than we would like to believe.  They affect us in a deeper way, because they get into our psychology, and we cope with them by accepting that they are a part of who we are.</p>

        <p>Stereotype threats are so dangerous, because it makes it so easy to create challenges where there doesn’t need to be.  You think to yourself, I’m not as smart as these people because of a, b, and c, and you allow that reasoning to suffice, creating a negativity loop, and brining yourself down.</p>

        <p>It again illustrated how profound positive feedback is.  Constantly telling yourself that you can do whatever it is your struggling with is so incredibly important in getting better at something.  As a jazz musician, one silly little lesson has helped me a long way.  When your on a gig, and playing a song you don’t know, I found that being timid is the worst thing to do.  It’s better to be “strong and wrong,” then to let everyone know you have no idea what your doing.</p>

        <p>I find this to be a version of me giving myself positive reinforcement.  Though borderline “blind confidence” I think the practice (as long as taken with a grain of humility) can go a long way.  I think one of the best modern day examples of this is examing the psychology of successfull atheletes.</p>

        <p>Do you think Michael Jordan ever thought, “crap, what if I miss the game winner?”  Maybe, but I bet not.  If you don’t let the negative thought creep in there, and your game will be elevated naturally.  Ricky Henderson used to stare at himself in the mirror before  games and say, "Ricky is the greatest," over and over. </p>

        <p>It's easy to laugh as these examples, but I think to do so is actually diminishing the value that it has.  By telling yourself every day that you can do the challenges ahead of you, it becomes part of how you think.  You approach a challenge by first saying, "I got this," instead of, "oh shit, I don't know about this."  That is a HUGE difference in the way you live your life.</p>

        <p>I’m going to keep this is mind as I keep learning here at Dev Bootcamp.  I can tell a lot of students here have more experience with programming than me, but as long as I don’t find myself falling into the negativity loop, everything will work out fine.</p>
