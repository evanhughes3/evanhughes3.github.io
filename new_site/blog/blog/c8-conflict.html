                            <p>This is a big one for me, and one that keeps coming up as I grow older.  Ulitmately the conflict is, do you disappoint your friends and not include them if the work suffers with them there.  It's a really, really, tough question, and one I don't have an answer for, but in this post I'm going to analyze it, and talk about the times it has happened in my life, and how I dealt with it.
          </p>

          <p>In high school, music was my life.  Berkeley High School has a world renownded jazz program, and after devoting my first 3 years of high school working hard to get there, my senior year I was lead drummer.  I was also given lead of a combo; comprised of 5 of the best players from the ensemble, whom I got to choose.  Should a teacher have been the one in charge of picking combo's?  Perhaps.  Looking back on it, it may have been too much of a burdon for an 17 year old like me to take on.  But, here is where the conflict arises.</p>

          <p>The problem was that I had a friend, who was also a senior, who assumed he would be part of the combo.  He wasn't a very strong musician, and though he enjoyed playing music, he was not as passionate about it as me, or the others in band.  I was worried he would bring the whole thing down.</p>

          <p>This was my passion and livelihood, I was fully commited to becoming a professional musician, going to music school after high school, and I also felt as though I had a tradition to keep up.  Berkeley High School usually won all of the festival competitions, and with me being in charge, I felt it would be a let down to the school and the tradition of Berkeley High to not win.  (Let me take a moment here to stay how stupid jazz competitions are...but when your in high school, you place great importance on stupid things like this.)</p>

          <p>It was an absolute crisis for me.  I have always been a well likeable person.  Disappointing people makes me feel horrible, but this was something I cared so much about.  I was completely torn, so I decided to talk to him about it, and see where he stood.</p>

          <p>When we talked about it, I saw how crushed he was going to be if he wasn't included.  He had waiting four years for this moment as well, and felt he deserved to be there.  I listened to him, and read his disappointment.  I decided that I would not be able to live with myself if I let down my friend this much.  Music was important to me, but completely ruining a relationship with a friend because of this was not worth it.</p>

          <p>So we included him in the combo, and you know what?  It was totally fine.  In repospect, I laugh at how much importance I put on that combo.  We we're in high school for god's sake!  But it did show me something, that I continue to come across in life.  The value of relationships compared to the value of success.  Sometimes you have to sacrifice a relationship in order to succeed, and that is really, really, hard.  The important distinction, and one that is so difficult to make is; is the success (or what you think success is) really worth ruining a relationship?</p>
