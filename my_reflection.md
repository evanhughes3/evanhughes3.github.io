## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

1.  At the top right on the page on GitHub, click the "+" botton and select "create new repository"
2.  Select yourself as the owner, and for name type "username.github.io"
3.  Make sure it is "public", initialized, and has a "MIT" license
4.  Make sure in settings that "Issues" is checked
5.  To clone the file to your local computer, go to your command line, and type "git clone (URL from GitHub page)"
6.  Type "git add (file)" to add file
7.  Type "git commit -m "message" to commit file
8.  Your repository should now appear in the folder you put it in

* Describe what open source means.  Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source is sharing the structure or code of how a program was made openly, so that anyone can see it, use it, a possibly change it.  It means that developers can offer up they're structure to be used and manipulated for a variety of different things.  The plus of this is that more ideas and more input will ultimately create a better program.  This differs from software that is not open source(photoshop, microsoft word) in which you pay to own the program but cannot manipulate it yourself.

I can see the benefits of having a program you write be open source, but it feels very selfless to do that.  Meaning you spend hours working on something tirelessly, then basically give it away for another, brighter programmer to make better.  Ultimately though, I think that this culture creates better innovation, which in a field like tech is very important.

* Assess the importance of using licenses

Using licenses in open source software can be a little confusing but generally there are a couple main types.  Public domain means it's available for anyone to use with no rules.  No one can claim ownership.  MIT is the next relaxed which basically means anyone can use, sell, distribute, as long as the license is attatched to it.  GPL(General Public License) means that you can manipulate, sell, distribute, but you have to include certain information in the softwares code along with a copy of the license.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I found that I was able to clone a copy of the respository from memory, which solidified my understanding from the forking & cloning challenge earlier on.  I am struggling to understand why we needed to create a seperate folder for our respositories, and how to get a file from one folder to that one.
