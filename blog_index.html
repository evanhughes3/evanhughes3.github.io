          <h4>Upon examaning all the values important to me, I found it hard to focus on only a couple of them, because they are all related in some way.  They represent important human qualities, and they represent how we treat ourselves, each other, and the world around us.  But the value I chose to reflect upon is enthusiasm...</h4>

          <h4>This week at DBC we started learning JavaScript.  Just as we we're just getting up on our two legs, starting to walk and run for the first time in ruby, we regressed back into the crawling stages of JavaScript.  Though similar to ruby in its OOP ways, JavaScript is different than ruby in many ways.  One of the most powerful tools in JavaScript is the object.  We're going to dive into that now...</h4>

          <h4>A fascinating new field in social psychology is the "Stereotype Threat."  Pioneered by Claude Steele, stereotype threat refers to the phenomenon of stereotyped individuals actually conforming to the stereotype they belong to.  The data is scary, because stereotype threats exist everywhere, and we are all constantly battling around them.  It shows us just how influenced we are by experiences around us, and how much our own psychology depends on our perception of ourselves. It reminds us how important positive re-enforcement is, and how detrimental negativity can be....</h4>

          <h4>This week we dove deeper in classes in Ruby.  Classes provide great organizational structure to your code, because they allow you to group your code, and be able to call certain methods from a class only if they correspond to that class.  If we think about Ruby's inheritance structure, Modules are the parents to classes.  Where as a class and all of it's attributes and methods apply to each instance of a class, a Module can be applied to a class if it is included in that class.  We'll dive into that now, using the example of my cute, cuddly, and sometimes evil cat Scarlett....</h4>

          <h4>When starting out at Dev Bootcamp, and reading about pair-programming, I thought only one thing; that this must be their way of forcing us to interact with our classmates.  One of the major problems with online education, though still in it's infancy, is there is no interaction between students.  So, it made sense to me why they would require this.  What I didn't really see coming was how beneficial pairing is to both learning and teaching the information...</h4>

          <h4>Before starting here at Dev Bootcamp, I was a music teacher in NYC.  The first week of every "mod" (as it was called) was tough, as any teacher will tell you.  You have a room full of new kids, many of whom you have never seen before, and your job is to start connecting and instructing them right away.  I thought it would make sense to make a nice little ruby program to help me remember the students in my class...</h4>
